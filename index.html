                    <p>This is a chrome extension published on the chrome web store. 
                        It helps students focus by eliminating all kinds of distraction on youtube. 
                        Until now, this extension has managed to gain 200+ users without any marketing. I was involved in 
                        JEE prep immediately after I published the extension and hence could not optimize it more. I used HTML, CSS and JS to build 
                        it and hence faced a lot of challenges.
                        
                        <br><br><b>This extension got the 'featured' tag from chrome web store and also got a 5-star rating.</b>

                    <p>Medfiles is a fully-functioning HealthTech solution that is designed for hospitals and clinics. It is a unified interface to access all your medical documents, recieve medical prescriptions, and also to gain analytics based on your uploaded records. It also eliminates the need for a custom software for each hospital. We used vanilla html, css, js for frontend and google firebase for backend. <br><br><b>This project won a whooping 50,000 Rupees at the HPE code wars hackathon 2022.</b> </p>

                    <p>This is probably the most beautiful website that I have worked on until now. Tachi is a hypothetical 5-star hotel chain that runs around the world. 
                        Again, upholding the legacy it was made completely from vanilla HTML, CSS and JS and was fully responsive.
                         Me along with my single teammate had to do a lot of brainstorming and hustling to create the website well within the time limit. 
                         I still recollect those days when we would simply not compromise the glory of this website. 
                        <br><br><b>This website won the 3rd prize at IIT bombay's techfest competition.</b>

                    <h5>Kalakar</h5>
                    <p>
                        Kalakar was a full-fledged startup idea. It was basically a marketplace for teenagers to earn from their skills at their age. 
                        In simple terms, it was an apprenticeship platform but it emphasized on earning experience more than earning money. 
                        I did the whole process of creating a large scale application, all by myself.
                        I created a full UI and backend flowchart before starting to build it. I also created two different apps, one for the customers and one for the skilled teenagers.
                        I used java, gradle, google firebase to execute this idea. However I had to give up on it due to my school exams.

                    <p>
                        OSDA stands for 'Odisha Skill Development Authority'. 
                        I made this project only for practice purposes when I was learning Web Development.
                        It exhibits all the basic stuff that a website has like a carousel for gallery, contact us form, navbar, footer etc.
                        It's deployed on github so you can check it out by clicking the button below.

                        No one can forget the bad old covid days when all the families were busy in playing different types of housie.
                        In reply to this trend, we made a ticket generator which can generate themed housie tickets. We used basic HTML, CSS and JS to build it. It's open for anyone to contribute via github.
